        <li><a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/">World of Warcraft</a></li>
            <p> World of Warcraft (WoW) is one of the most successful subscription based MMORPG within our current generation. World of Warcraft was created in 2004 by Blizzard Entertainment , and this game is the lore of the universe continues off Blizzard's other successful game Warcraft: Orcs & Humans which was unveiled in 1994. Blizzard Entertainment has continued to update the game with more and more content thoughout the years keeping the legacy players playing. </p>
        <li><a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/">Guild Wars 2</a></li>
            <p>Guild Wars 2 is one of my current favorite MMORPG to date (fyi I might be a little bit biased) and honestly I think it's one of the most <strong> unique </strong> games to date. I've only played it for a few months but recently it spiked in popularity considering quite a bit of World Of Warcraft players are making the big change. Guild Wars has many different locations within it's world that will continue to have thriving communities with events and much more. </p>
        <li><a href="http://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/">Final Fantasy XIV</a></li>
            <p>Final Fantasy XIV , which is also known as Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn is the second installment of Final Fantasy's series of MMORPG. I never played this MMORPG but from what I read from around the internet, Final Fantasy XIV is very much a great MMORPG still using the traditional combat system. This is another game which is taking many players from World of Warcraft. </p>
        <li><a href="http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/agegate">Elder Scrolls Online</a></li>
            <p>The Elder Scrolls Online is the first installment of an MMORPG set in the Elder Scrolls universe, and from my knowledge it didn't do so well when released but after a few updates it's become a very popular game. Unlike many MMORPG's users can play Elder Scrolls Online on console platform </p>
        <li><a href="https://www.eveonline.com/">EVE</a></li>
            <p>Eve Online is one of the few successful space like mmorpg's in which the player stays within the spacecraft. It has PvE (Player vs Enemy) and a heavy PvP (Player vs Player) gameplay modes. I personally have no experience with this game and I probably will never play it considering my taste are for much more fast pace games. </p>
        <li><a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/archeage/en/">ArcheAge</a></li>
            <p> Archeage is another MMORPG that was developer by Korean developers and essentially the game tries to reach for a more "sandbox" style gameplay. Players aren't geared towards the typical grind of killing monsters over and over again, players can focus on other things like crafting and still succcessfully explore all aspects of the game.  </p>
        <li><a href="http://www.swtor.com/">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></li>
            <p>Star Wars: The Old Republic is the first MMORPG set within the Star Wars Universe, and it's won plenty of acclaim simply because of it's quick endgame and great storyline within a MMORPG. </p>
        <li><a href="http://tera.enmasse.com/">TERA</a></li>
            <p> TERA is one of the only action based mmorpg's that aren't dungeon crawlers like most games.</p>
        <li><a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/rift/en/?affiliateId=1">RIFT</a></li>
            <p>Rift a game very similiar to World of Warcraft , in terms of very huge similiarites within the lore. Many of my collegues dislike the game simply because the user has to purchase classes with real life currency. </p>
        <li><a href="http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/">WildStar</a></li>
            <p>WildStar is another game made by Arena Net and very similiar to Guild Wars 2 but based within a very Sci Fi setting.</p>
